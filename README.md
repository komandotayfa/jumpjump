# About Game
You are a knight that likes to do frontflip and you are supposed to go right.

**This is my first video game ever so it is very basic and somewhat trash but it is my trash!**

You can use arrow keys (left stick) or WASD for movement.

Space (A button in XBOX or equivalent) or W or Up Arrow for jump.

R or M (B button for XBOX or equivalent) for menu.

Backspace (Menu button for XBOX or equivalent) for restarting game.
